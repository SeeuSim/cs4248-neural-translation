# Investigation into the Impact of Tokenization, Model Architecture and Word Embeddings on Neural Machine Translation

Team 42's Submission for CS4248, taken in AY23/24 S2 at the National University of Singapore.

This repository hosts our experiments on Neural Machine Translation approaches, using the [iwslt-2017 en-zh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/iwslt2017/viewer/iwslt2017-en-zh) dataset.

## Introduction

Given the large task of Neural Machine Translation, we hope to explore various approaches for different parts of the translation process, namely:

- Tokenization
- Embedding Representations
- Model Architecture
