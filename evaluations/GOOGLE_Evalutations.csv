"And the third is the focusing illusion,  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance  that affects well-being  without distorting its importance.",第三个陷阱则是聚焦错觉， 令人遗憾的是，任何情况下，当我们想到一些 关于快乐生活的情景时， 我们势必会觉得它特别重要。,第三个是聚焦错觉，不幸的是，我们无法在不扭曲其重要性的情况下思考任何影响幸福感的情况。,41.252,34.081,25.586,17.456,21.447,18.383,64.286,0.407,0.524,0.458,0.219,0.292,0.25,0.364,0.462,0.407,0.758,0.779,0.768

"Implicit in this phrase of ""overcoming adversity""  is the idea that success, or happiness,  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience  unscathed or unmarked by the experience,  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability  to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,  or what other people perceive as my disability.",“克服逆境”这个词有一个隐含的意思 那就是成功，或者快乐 都在一段艰难的经历的另一端 而这段经历本身却与成功和快乐无关 就好像是说，我这一生之所以能成功 是因为我绕过了作为一个截肢人所要面临的一系列挑战 绕过在别人看来制约我的一些因素,“克服逆境”这句话隐含的意思是，成功或幸福是在充满挑战的经历的另一边毫发无伤或不受该经历的影响，就好像我生活中的成功来自于回避的能力一样。或者绕过假肢生活中假定的陷阱，或者其他人认为我的残疾的东西。,44.74,32.426,23.778,18.279,18.392,15.764,66.667,0.346,0.4,0.371,0.154,0.164,0.159,0.318,0.328,0.323,0.714,0.725,0.72

"By not treating the wholeness of a person,  by not acknowledging their potency,  we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.",我们不从一个整体的角度看待残疾人 不去承认他们的能力 这对他们本身就很艰难的处境无疑是雪上加霜,如果不对待一个人的整体性，不承认他们的潜力，我们就会在他们可能有的自然斗争之上制造另一种疾病。,53.191,30.415,18.338,12.939,14.02,12.017,82.222,0.304,0.28,0.292,0.08,0.069,0.074,0.308,0.267,0.286,0.695,0.698,0.696
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.,我们能有效地对一个人对其所在社会的的价值进行评估,我们正在有效地评估某人对我们社区的价值。,57.311,41.578,25.054,13.95,19.659,16.85,50,0.5,0.636,0.56,0.133,0.182,0.154,0.375,0.5,0.429,0.797,0.83,0.813
So we need to see through the pathology  and into the range of human capability.,因此，我们的目光不应该局限在残疾人生理上的缺陷 而是应该注意到他们作为人的价值,因此，我们需要看透病态并了解人类能力的范围。,15.375,11.896,10.085,8.499,13.658,11.707,81.579,0.2,0.308,0.242,0.091,0.167,0.118,0.174,0.308,0.222,0.664,0.73,0.696

"So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times  as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.",所以，艰辛的奋斗岁月是不该被贬低、否定的 这不是什么我们要避免或者掩盖的事 恰恰相反，我们应该在逆境中寻找机遇,因此，这并不是要贬低或否定这些更加艰难的时期，将其视为我们想要避免或掩盖的事情，而是要在逆境中找到那些机会。,51.852,35.663,24.483,17.141,15.633,13.4,75.472,0.464,0.433,0.448,0.097,0.088,0.092,0.375,0.343,0.358,0.764,0.766,0.765
"So maybe the idea I want to put out there is  not so much overcoming adversity  as it is opening ourselves up to it,  embracing it,  grappling with it,  to use a wrestling term,  maybe even dancing with it.","其实，我想说明的道理就是 逆境，不是用来""克服""的 我们应该坦然面对它 拥抱它 与它摔打 我刚才用了一个摔角的术语（摔打） 甚至，与它舞蹈",因此，也许我想表达的想法与其说是克服逆境，不如说是向它敞开心扉，拥抱它，与它搏斗，用摔跤的术语来说，甚至可能与它共舞。,50.682,32.581,20.568,10.977,14.535,12.458,69.841,0.387,0.444,0.414,0.15,0.171,0.16,0.405,0.459,0.43,0.71,0.712,0.711
"And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,  we're less burdened by the presence of it.",也许，如果我们能把逆境看成是自然的、不间断的、对人有用的东西 它的存在对我们来说也不再是负担了,而且，也许，如果我们认为逆境是自然的、持续的和有用的，我们就会因为它的存在而减轻负担。,56.39,47.475,38.348,30.974,27.195,23.31,54.348,0.5,0.545,0.522,0.321,0.333,0.327,0.5,0.536,0.517,0.788,0.815,0.802

"To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,  nor is it the most intelligent that survives;  it is the one that is most adaptable to change.",他说的那句话大概意思就是，能生存下来的物种 往往不是最强壮的，也不是最聪明的 而是最能适应外部环境变化的,换句话说：生存下来的不是最强大的物种，也不是最聪明的物种。它是最能适应变化的。,61.886,53.152,45.167,37.275,39.928,34.224,50,0.522,0.667,0.585,0.357,0.455,0.4,0.533,0.64,0.582,0.782,0.859,0.818

"From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that  the human ability to survive and flourish  is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict  into transformation.",达尔文等诸位大师的著作都揭示了这一点 人类生存繁衍的能力 源自人类灵魂经历激烈斗争后的转变 就是这样,从达尔文等人的著作中，我们可以认识到，人类生存和繁荣的能力是由人类精神通过冲突转化为变革的斗争所驱动的。,44.231,32.26,23.201,15.026,13.974,11.977,72.34,0.333,0.276,0.302,0.154,0.121,0.136,0.407,0.324,0.361,0.764,0.743,0.754

Is it something about the light?,还是关于光线？,是不是跟光有关？,50,18.898,11.417,7.81,8.333,7.143,71.429,0.25,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.766,0.75,0.758
What creates the illusion?,是什么促成了这种幻觉？,是什么造成了这种错觉？,81.818,70.065,54.697,37.818,31.275,26.807,18.182,0.714,0.714,0.714,0.333,0.333,0.333,0.714,0.714,0.714,0.938,0.938,0.938
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.,有时候不同的视角造成不同的幻觉,有时，观点是幻觉。,22.819,17.114,10.241,6.923,11.574,9.921,80,0.167,0.167,0.167,0,0,0,0.125,0.167,0.143,0.681,0.763,0.72
"But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world  and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.",但最终，还是要归结于我们如何理解这个世界 以及这种理解如何在一个二维空间得以体现,但最终，这取决于我们如何解释世界以及如何在二维表面上实现世界。,52.334,41.857,33.423,25.336,26.108,22.379,53.846,0.421,0.5,0.457,0.25,0.294,0.27,0.429,0.5,0.462,0.767,0.836,0.8
"It's not really what is realistic,  it's what we think looks realistic really.",这并不是关于什么是真的 而是关于我们认为什么看起来像是真的,这并不是真正的现实，而是我们认为看起来真实的东西。,60.311,47.21,35.027,24.262,23.416,20.071,57.143,0.583,0.5,0.538,0.214,0.214,0.214,0.467,0.467,0.467,0.742,0.777,0.759
So I think the basics  are quite simple.,所以我认为这些基本原理 其实很简单,所以我认为基础知识非常简单。,49.536,40.64,32.956,27.406,24.798,21.255,56.25,0.375,0.5,0.429,0.286,0.4,0.333,0.375,0.5,0.429,0.804,0.849,0.826
I just see it as a puzzle of reality  where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together  to create alternate reality.,我把它看做是现实世界的一个拼图 在这里你可以把现实世界的不同片段拼凑起来 创造另一种真实,我只是将其视为现实的谜题，你可以将不同的现实片段组合在一起以创建替代现实。,47.222,26.221,11.972,6.852,12.263,10.511,69.048,0.364,0.4,0.381,0.043,0.043,0.043,0.269,0.292,0.28,0.77,0.794,0.782
And let me show you a simple example.,让我来举个简单的例子,让我向您展示一个简单的例子。,57.143,51.355,44.465,39.35,32.502,27.859,60,0.714,0.5,0.588,0.5,0.333,0.4,0.714,0.5,0.588,0.865,0.817,0.84
"Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,  something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.",这里有三个完全可想象到并真实存在的物体 我们可以在现实的三维世界里找到它们,这里我们有三个完全可以想象的物理对象，我们都可以将其与生活在三维世界中联系起来。,55,42.817,30.705,23.652,20.558,17.621,63.889,0.524,0.478,0.5,0.143,0.125,0.133,0.5,0.44,0.468,0.8,0.789,0.795
"But combined in a certain way,  they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,  like it could exist.",但若将这些物体用某种方式组合起来 就可以创造出视觉上依然是三维的物体 就好像它是会存在的,但以某种方式结合起来，它们可以创造出看起来仍然是三维的东西，就像它可能存在一样。,54.696,44.733,35.591,27.591,23.119,19.816,57.143,0.542,0.542,0.542,0.185,0.208,0.196,0.464,0.52,0.491,0.813,0.819,0.816
"But at the same time, we know it can't.",但是同时我们很清楚它不可能存在,但与此同时，我们知道这是不可能的。,52.941,36.38,20.664,13.324,14.101,12.087,60,0.333,0.273,0.3,0.125,0.1,0.111,0.333,0.273,0.3,0.818,0.779,0.798
"So we trick our brains,  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact  that it doesn't really make sense.",就这样我们骗了自己的大脑 因为大脑就是不肯接受 这个物体其实并不存在这一事实,所以我们欺骗了我们的大脑，因为我们的大脑根本不接受这样的事实：它确实没有意义。,48.718,35.806,19.065,9.905,13.407,11.491,66.667,0.45,0.474,0.462,0.05,0.048,0.049,0.381,0.333,0.356,0.76,0.777,0.768
with combining photographs.,组合照片,结合照片。,60,54.772,46.416,39.764,35.833,28.667,50,0.5,0.333,0.4,0,0,0,0.5,0.333,0.4,0.755,0.744,0.749
It's just really about combining different realities.,也是如此 确实只是把不同的现实画面组合起来,这实际上就是将不同的现实结合起来。,49.307,39.369,32.599,25.379,24.161,20.71,60,0.333,0.4,0.364,0.182,0.222,0.2,0.333,0.4,0.364,0.764,0.809,0.786
"So the things that make a photograph look realistic,  I think it's the things that we don't even think about,  the things all around us in our daily lives.",所以使一张照片看起来逼真的事物 是那些我们平时甚至不会去想 但在日常生活中随处可见的东西,因此，让照片看起来真实的东西，我认为是我们甚至没有想到的东西，是我们日常生活中周围的东西。,46.667,35.675,27.466,21.076,17.437,14.946,73.81,0.409,0.474,0.439,0.136,0.136,0.136,0.435,0.37,0.4,0.786,0.818,0.801
"But when combining photographs,  this is really important to consider,  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.",但是当我们组合照片的时候 这点就值得我们着重思考了 否则它看起来就会别扭,但在组合照片时，考虑这一点确实很重要，因为否则它看起来就会有点不对劲。,51.429,38.892,33.223,28.796,24.456,20.962,70.588,0.389,0.333,0.359,0.263,0.238,0.25,0.35,0.318,0.333,0.78,0.772,0.776
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow  to achieve a realistic result.,我想说的是我们要遵守三个简单的原则 为了达到一个逼真的效果,所以我想说，要达到现实的结果，需要遵循三个简单的规则。,53.536,39.842,29.034,21.055,19.168,16.429,78.571,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.235,0.235,0.235,0.389,0.389,0.389,0.774,0.789,0.781
"As you can see, these images aren't really special.",你们看，这些图像并不特别,正如您所看到的，这些图像并不是很特别。,52.632,45.241,39.192,35.025,30.036,25.745,75,0.625,0.385,0.476,0.429,0.25,0.316,0.625,0.385,0.476,0.84,0.742,0.788
"But combined, they can create something like this.",但是组合起来，它们就可以创造出这样的画面,但结合起来，他们可以创造出这样的东西。,69.906,60.701,54.793,49.185,43.649,37.413,35,0.583,0.583,0.583,0.455,0.455,0.455,0.583,0.583,0.583,0.882,0.887,0.884
So the first rule is that photos combined  should have the same perspective.,所以第一原则就是所有被组合的照片 都展现同样的视角,所以第一条规则是组合的照片应该具有相同的视角。,66.605,51.077,41.479,31.818,26.551,22.758,50,0.385,0.417,0.4,0.231,0.25,0.24,0.429,0.462,0.444,0.821,0.83,0.826
"Secondly, photos combined  should have the same type of light.",第二，被组合的照片 还要有相同的光线,其次，组合的照片应该具有相同类型的光线。,60,50.262,41.247,30.143,24.65,21.128,52.941,0.6,0.545,0.571,0.3,0.273,0.286,0.636,0.583,0.609,0.888,0.866,0.877
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --  shot at the same height and in the same type of light.,这两张照片都符合这两样要求 它们都摄于相同的拍摄高度和相同的光线下,而这两张图片都满足了这两个要求——在相同的高度和相同的光线下拍摄。,69.697,59.033,46.597,37.716,33.376,28.608,40.625,0.688,0.579,0.629,0.333,0.286,0.308,0.65,0.565,0.605,0.873,0.858,0.865
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish  where the different images begin and end  by making it seamless.,第三个原则是要让人难以分辨 这些不同照片的衔接点 使衔接看起来天衣无缝,第三个是通过使其无缝化，使人们无法区分不同图像的开始和结束位置。,36.346,21.32,11.367,7.038,8.956,7.677,81.818,0.294,0.263,0.278,0,0,0,0.222,0.2,0.211,0.715,0.722,0.718
Make it impossible to say  how the image actually was composed.,使任何人都道不出 这图片是如何创作而成的,让人无法说出图像实际上是如何构成的。,42.043,26.492,16.069,10.695,11.39,9.763,78.947,0.25,0.273,0.261,0.091,0.1,0.095,0.25,0.273,0.261,0.775,0.785,0.78
"So by matching color, contrast and brightness  in the borders between the different images,  adding photographic defects  like depth of field,  desaturated colors and noise,  we erase the borders between the different images  and make it look like one single image,  despite the fact that one image  can contain hundreds of layers basically.",通过匹配不同照片边缘的 色彩，对比度以及亮度 再加入一下摄影瑕疵 比如视野的深度 去饱和的色彩和噪音 我们可以除去不同照片之间的边界 使其看起来就像是一张单一的照片 即使一张照片 可包含上百个图层,因此，通过匹配不同图像之间边界的颜色、对比度和亮度，添加景深、去饱和颜色和噪点等摄影缺陷，我们消除了不同图像之间的边界，使其看起来像一张图像，尽管事实上一张图像基本上可以包含数百个图层。,58.065,42.782,30.423,22.367,19.915,17.07,62.222,0.512,0.553,0.532,0.146,0.143,0.144,0.412,0.396,0.404,0.837,0.83,0.834
So here's another example.,这里还有一个例子,这是另一个例子。,62.5,51.755,44.695,36.556,26.448,22.67,50,0.5,0.333,0.4,0.333,0.2,0.25,0.5,0.333,0.4,0.773,0.79,0.781
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape  and the lower part is what's manipulated.,有人可能认为这只是一张风景图 下面的部分是处理过的,人们可能会认为这只是一幅风景图像，下部是经过处理的。,73.077,51.291,37.985,29.078,26.134,22.401,45.833,0.538,0.438,0.483,0.154,0.133,0.143,0.5,0.438,0.467,0.851,0.846,0.849
But this image is actually entirely composed  of photographs from different locations.,但是这张照片其实整个都是 由不同地方拍摄的很多照片组合起来的,但这张图片实际上完全是由不同地点的照片组成的。,50.242,35.093,26.242,19.316,21.891,18.764,55.172,0.4,0.462,0.429,0.125,0.154,0.138,0.412,0.5,0.452,0.824,0.856,0.839
"I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place  than to find a place,  because then you don't need to compromise  with the ideas in your head.",我个人认为创造一个地方比找到一个地方 要容易一些 因为你不用 与自己大脑的想法妥协,我个人认为，实际创建一个地方比找到一个地方更容易，因为这样你就不需要向你头脑中的想法妥协。,66.667,55.048,47.283,41.688,35.421,30.361,44.737,0.65,0.52,0.578,0.4,0.296,0.34,0.682,0.517,0.588,0.894,0.863,0.878
But it does require a lot of planning.,但是这确实需要很多规划,但这确实需要大量的计划。,58.333,46.057,39.924,34.484,26.57,22.774,54.545,0.5,0.375,0.429,0.4,0.286,0.333,0.5,0.375,0.429,0.887,0.866,0.876
"And getting this idea during winter,  I knew that I had several months to plan it,  to find the different locations  for the pieces of the puzzle basically.",去年冬天产生这个想法时 我知道我有几个月的时间去规划这件事 基本上要到不同的地点 找这一拼图所需的图片,在冬天得到这个想法时，我知道我有几个月的时间来计划它，基本上找到拼图碎片的不同位置。,61.92,49.875,41.229,35.328,35.53,30.454,47.917,0.483,0.583,0.528,0.29,0.346,0.316,0.469,0.556,0.508,0.831,0.863,0.847
"So for example,  the fish was captured on a fishing trip.",比如 这条鱼摄于一次垂钓航行,例如，这条鱼是在一次钓鱼之旅中捕获的。,36.842,24.78,15.343,10.307,9.899,8.484,100,0.429,0.231,0.3,0.167,0.083,0.111,0.429,0.231,0.3,0.809,0.747,0.777

"And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red  to make it look more Swedish.",对了，我还把岛上的房子调成红色的了 使它看起来更具瑞典风,是的，我什至把岛上的房子变成了红色，让它看起来更像瑞典人。,68.966,54.366,42.475,34.841,28.858,24.735,40.741,0.5,0.529,0.514,0.211,0.222,0.216,0.4,0.421,0.41,0.869,0.85,0.859
"So to achieve a realistic result,  I think it comes down to planning.",为了达到一个逼真的效果 我认为最重要的就是规划,因此，要实现现实的结果，我认为归根结底是规划。,39.13,26.673,18.923,11.408,11.139,9.548,72.727,0.333,0.308,0.32,0.083,0.077,0.08,0.308,0.286,0.296,0.724,0.713,0.718
"It always starts with a sketch, an idea.",总是会先出现一个大概的构思和想法,它总是从草图、想法开始。,23.884,17.64,10.369,6.863,8.586,7.359,87.5,0.222,0.25,0.235,0,0,0,0.222,0.25,0.235,0.687,0.718,0.702
Then it's about combining the different photographs.,然后就是组合不同的照片,然后就是将不同的照片组合起来。,73.333,64.734,54.421,44.803,33.838,29.004,45.455,1,0.667,0.8,0.6,0.375,0.462,0.833,0.556,0.667,0.929,0.862,0.894

"Because I usually take the role  of trying to explain to people  how wonderful the new technologies  that are coming along are going to be,  and I thought that, since I was among friends here,  I would tell you what I really think  and try to look back and try to understand  what is really going on here  with these amazing jumps in technology  that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.",由于我经常 向人们解释 即将到来的新科技 将会多么的美妙 我想既然我跟各位朋友们一起在这 就让我来说说我真正的想法 并试着回顾和理解 这到底是如何发生的 有了这些科技上的惊人进步。 科技的进步似乎快到我们根本无法赶上它的脚步。,因为我通常扮演的角色是试图向人们解释即将出现的新技术将是多么美妙，而且我想，既然我是这里的朋友，我会告诉你我的真实想法并尝试看看回过头来尝试了解这些令人惊叹的技术飞跃到底发生了什么，这些飞跃似乎如此之快，以至于我们几乎无法跟上它。,56.522,34.495,19.462,12.738,15.31,13.123,74.038,0.42,0.412,0.416,0.094,0.09,0.092,0.369,0.353,0.361,0.777,0.77,0.773

This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing  about the power of RISC microprocessors  versus the power of local area networks.,这个是我们做的 关于RISC精简指令集微处理器功率 与本地网路功率分析的幻灯片。,这恰好是我们对 RISC 微处理器的能力与局域网的能力进行的一些分析的幻灯片。,54.263,41.909,34.935,28.586,26.651,19.988,65.714,0.529,0.562,0.545,0.222,0.222,0.222,0.474,0.45,0.462,0.78,0.787,0.783
"And the interesting thing about it  is that this slide,  like so many technology slides that we're used to,  is a sort of a straight line  on a semi-log curve.",有趣的是 这页幻灯片 就像很多我们所熟悉的幻灯片一样， 是半对数曲线图 上的一条直线。,有趣的是，这张幻灯片就像我们习惯的许多技术幻灯片一样，是半对数曲线上的一条直线。,82.5,72.722,65.292,58.901,50.254,43.075,28.205,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.565,0.542,0.553,0.792,0.76,0.776,0.924,0.919,0.922
"In other words, every step here  represents an order of magnitude  in performance scale.",也就是这里的每一层， 代表了性能程度 大小的一级。,换句话说，这里的每一步都代表了性能规模的一个数量级。,57.692,48.038,38.64,31.649,24.862,21.311,56.522,0.571,0.571,0.571,0.286,0.286,0.286,0.533,0.533,0.533,0.805,0.767,0.785
And this is a new thing  that we talk about technology  on semi-log curves.,在半对数曲线图上 讨论科技， 这很新鲜。,这是我们谈论半对数曲线技术的一个新事物。,50,32.444,25.984,21.315,17.622,15.105,83.333,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.091,0.091,0.091,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.779,0.74,0.759

"If you could bring up the lights higher,  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.",请把灯开亮点， 因为我要用张纸。,如果你能把灯调高一点就好了，因为我只是想用一张纸。,44,33.166,24.299,15.981,14.431,12.37,93.333,0.5,0.263,0.345,0.111,0.056,0.074,0.5,0.263,0.345,0.845,0.732,0.784
Now why do we draw technology curves  in semi-log curves?,为什么我们要用对数曲线 描绘科技曲线呢？,那么为什么我们要用半对数曲线来绘制技术曲线呢？,73.913,63.495,55.697,47.715,38.036,32.602,31.579,0.6,0.5,0.545,0.4,0.333,0.364,0.636,0.538,0.583,0.923,0.874,0.898
"Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve  where, let's say, this is years,  this is time of some sort,  and this is whatever measure of the technology  that I'm trying to graph,  the graphs look sort of silly.",嗯，答案是，如果我用普通曲线画， 我们说，这是年份， 这是某个时间， 这是我准备画的 科技的某种测量值， 这图看起来有点傻。,答案是，如果我把它画在一条正常曲线上，比如说，这是几年，这是某种时间，这就是我试图绘制的技术的任何衡量标准，图表看起来有点像愚蠢的。,60.606,45.291,35.535,28.296,23.391,20.049,59.649,0.5,0.452,0.475,0.167,0.158,0.162,0.5,0.475,0.487,0.834,0.796,0.815

"Now if I graph, for instance,  some other technology, say transportation technology,  on a semi-log curve,  it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.",现在，如果我画，比如说， 另一种技术，像是交通运输， 在半对数曲线上， 它看起来很蠢，会像条很平的线。,现在，如果我将其他一些技术（例如交通技术）绘制在半对数曲线上，它看起来会非常愚蠢，它看起来像一条平坦的线。,62.264,50.145,41.975,36.5,32.189,27.591,56.25,0.64,0.552,0.593,0.367,0.355,0.361,0.548,0.5,0.523,0.847,0.854,0.85

"So if transportation technology  was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,  then the day after tomorrow,  I would be able to get in a taxi cab  and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.",如果交通运输技术 进步地像微处理器技术一样快的话， 那，后天 我就能搭一辆出租车 然后在30秒内到东京。,因此，如果交通技术的发展速度与微处理器技术一样快，那么后天，我就能在 30 秒内坐上出租车并到达东京。,72.917,59.735,47.71,37.276,32.896,24.672,44.681,0.654,0.607,0.63,0.333,0.3,0.316,0.607,0.548,0.576,0.889,0.884,0.887
It's not moving like that. And there's nothing precedented  in the history of technology development  of this kind of self-feeding growth  where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.,但它并没有进步得那么快。 在科技发展历史中 也没有任何 这种自给自足， 每几年程度翻倍增长的先例。,它不是那样移动的。在技​​术发展史上，这种每隔几年就会出现数量级增长的自我增长是史无前例的。,43.478,24.077,10.963,6.256,9.847,8.441,84.444,0.269,0.304,0.286,0.037,0.038,0.038,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.731,0.748,0.739
"Now the question that I'd like to ask is,  if you look at these exponential curves,  they don't go on forever.",现在我想要问的是， 如果你观察这些指数曲线， 它们并非永远的持续下去。,现在我想问的问题是，如果你看看这些指数曲线，它们不会永远持续下去。,81.818,73.276,63.809,55.556,45.153,38.703,21.212,0.842,0.8,0.821,0.55,0.55,0.55,0.81,0.81,0.81,0.926,0.93,0.928

Now I think that the reason  is because we all feel  that something's happening there.,我想原因是 我们都感觉到 正在发生些什么。,现在我认为原因是因为我们都觉得那里正在发生一些事情。,53.846,38.829,29.29,18.181,17.143,14.694,68.421,0.538,0.5,0.519,0.167,0.154,0.16,0.538,0.5,0.519,0.868,0.815,0.84

"And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense  to think out 30, 50 years  because everything's going to be so different  that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing  just doesn't make any sense at all.",我们知道去考虑那未来的三、五十年 已经没什么意义了， 因为每件事都将如此不同 以至于推测将来 不再有意义。,我们知道，设想 30 年、50 年的时间并没有多大意义，因为一切都会变得如此不同，对我们正在做的事情进行简单的推断根本没有任何意义。,39.344,26.857,19.43,12.611,11.501,8.626,91.837,0.407,0.355,0.379,0.148,0.105,0.123,0.393,0.282,0.328,0.774,0.768,0.771
"So what I would like to talk about  is what that could be,  what that transition could be that we're going through.",所以我要聊聊 那会是怎样， 我们正在经历的转变会是怎样。,所以我想谈谈这可能是什么，我们正在经历的转变可能是什么。,57.143,48.25,43.194,38.757,34.54,29.605,46.154,0.643,0.6,0.621,0.357,0.333,0.345,0.625,0.556,0.588,0.901,0.885,0.893
Now in order to do that  I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff  that really has nothing to do  with technology and computers.,为达到这个目的， 我得介绍一堆东西 它们与 科技和电脑完全无关。,现在为了做到这一点，我将不得不谈论一堆与技术和计算机实际上无关的东西。,48.571,26.726,10.267,5.392,10.546,9.04,79.31,0.444,0.4,0.421,0.059,0.053,0.056,0.389,0.35,0.368,0.785,0.767,0.776
Because I think the only way to understand this  is to really step back  and take a long time scale look at things.,因为我决定理解这个的唯一方法 就是回顾过去 拉长时间轴去看。,因为我认为理解这一点的唯一方法就是真正退后一步，用很长的时间尺度来看待事物。,47.368,37.527,30.141,23.652,20.476,17.551,71.429,0.533,0.381,0.444,0.286,0.19,0.229,0.533,0.364,0.432,0.812,0.75,0.78
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on  is the time scale of life on Earth.,而我所要看的时间轴 是以地球上生命的时间跨度来看。,所以我想研究这个问题的时间尺度是地球上生命的时间尺度。,62.963,46.685,39.37,33.579,29.573,25.348,58.333,0.467,0.538,0.5,0.2,0.231,0.214,0.5,0.533,0.516,0.796,0.778,0.787
So I think this picture makes sense  if you look at it a few billion years at a time.,我想这幅图合理了 如果你每次从几十亿年跨度来看。,所以我认为如果你一次看几十亿年的话，这张图是有道理的。,51.852,31.578,22.873,14.943,14.542,12.464,82.609,0.308,0.235,0.267,0.083,0.062,0.071,0.308,0.235,0.267,0.783,0.767,0.775
"So if you go back  about two and a half billion years,  the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock  with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.",所以如果你回溯个 大概25亿年， 地球这么大，贫瘠的大块石头 上面浮着些化学物质。,因此，如果你回到大约二十亿年前，地球就是一块巨大的、贫瘠的岩石，上面漂浮着大量的化学物质。,60,43.693,31.44,21.706,19.613,16.811,59.459,0.429,0.409,0.419,0.19,0.16,0.174,0.409,0.346,0.375,0.835,0.821,0.828
"And if you look at the way  that the chemicals got organized,  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.",要是观察 这些化学物质怎样组合的， 我们开始弄明白它们怎么形成的。,如果你观察化学物质的组织方式，我们就会开始很好地了解它们是如何运作的。,51.429,36.896,23.131,14.023,15.019,12.874,70.968,0.5,0.381,0.432,0.125,0.095,0.108,0.529,0.409,0.462,0.836,0.794,0.814
"And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand  about how it started with RNA,  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,  which is that, at that time,  there were little drops of oil floating around  with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.",我想有些理论是从理解 生命怎样从核糖核酸演变开始， 但是我想讲一个生命的简单故事， 就是，在那个时候， 有一滴滴的油四处浮动， 里面有各种不同化学成分组合。,我认为有些理论已经开始理解它是如何从 RNA 开始的，但我要讲一个简单的故事，那就是，当时，有一些小油滴漂浮在周围，其中含有各种不同配方的化学品。,61.544,41.33,27.872,17.457,18.483,13.862,54.795,0.514,0.5,0.507,0.143,0.14,0.141,0.477,0.477,0.477,0.807,0.82,0.813
And some of those drops of oil  had a particular combination of chemicals in them  which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside  and grow the drops of oil.,有些油滴 里面含有特殊的化学构成 这导致它们可以从外界聚集化学物质 并慢慢变大。,其中一些油滴中含有特定的化学物质组合，导致它们吸收外部的化学物质并形成油滴。,55.263,44.064,35.074,24.661,20.689,17.733,56.757,0.381,0.471,0.421,0.1,0.111,0.105,0.381,0.4,0.39,0.818,0.849,0.833

"We there put out six different flavors of jam  or 24 different flavors of jam,  and we looked at two things:  First, in which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?",我们在那儿摆6种 或24种不同味道的果酱， 然后我们观察了两件事： 第一，人们在哪种情况下 更愿意停下脚步品尝一些果酱？,我们推出了六种不同口味的果酱或 24 种不同口味的果酱，我们研究了两件事：首先，在什么情况下人们更有可能停下来品尝一些果酱？,62.712,49.868,39.382,31.477,27.264,20.448,50.909,0.633,0.679,0.655,0.324,0.344,0.333,0.6,0.583,0.592,0.857,0.873,0.865
"More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent.",相比较下，大部分，约60%的人，在有24种果酱走廊停了脚步， 而当有6种果酱时 只有40%的人。,24 人时停下来的人（约 60%）比 6 人时停下来的人（约 40%）要多。,34.578,19.66,9.637,5.725,15.931,11.948,79.07,0.32,0.533,0.4,0.067,0.125,0.087,0.182,0.273,0.218,0.647,0.713,0.679
The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam.,我们观察的另一件事是： 在人们在哪种情况下更愿意 买一罐果酱,我们接下来要考虑的是在哪种情况下人们更有可能购买一罐果酱。,62.069,49.38,39.836,33.205,27.113,23.24,53.571,0.588,0.556,0.571,0.235,0.235,0.235,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.807,0.807,0.807

"Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.",而此时，在那些在有6种果酱时停下的人们中， 我们发现有30%的人 买了果酱。,在 6 个人就停下来的人中，现在我们发现 30% 的人实际上买了一罐果酱。,62.598,46.971,32.23,21.413,23.854,17.891,60,0.619,0.684,0.65,0.24,0.316,0.273,0.538,0.667,0.596,0.826,0.817,0.821
"Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  at least it's good for our waistlines --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions. We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.",现在如果你算一下的话， 当人们只有六种选择时， 比有24种时 买果酱的倾向上升了至少六倍 选择不买果酱 也许对我们来说是一件好事儿 至少对我们的水桶腰来说， 但是结果证明过度选择甚至在 非常重要的决定上影响我们。 我们甚至在有悖个人利益的情况下， 宁愿放弃选择。,现在如果你算一下，人们购买一罐果酱的可能性至少是原来的六倍现在选择不买一罐果酱可能对我们有好处——至少对我们的腰围有好处——但事实证明这种选择过多的问题甚至会影响我们做出非常重要的决定。我们选择不选择，即使它违背了我们的最佳自身利益。,64.146,47.579,35.338,26.959,24.604,21.089,60,0.451,0.5,0.474,0.209,0.222,0.215,0.429,0.429,0.429,0.768,0.773,0.77

And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.,我们发现， 这之前却是有联系。,我们发现确实存在相关性。,35.27,28.535,23.977,18.976,16.675,14.293,64.286,0.333,0.5,0.4,0.125,0.2,0.154,0.333,0.5,0.4,0.735,0.781,0.757
"So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.",于是在这些计划中，我们选择了657个 从提供2到59种基金 的不同计划。,因此，在这些计划中，我们有大约 657 个计划，范围从向人们提供两种到 59 种不同的基金产品。,60.976,47.818,36.064,29.336,28.993,21.744,61.29,0.81,0.68,0.739,0.381,0.296,0.333,0.682,0.536,0.6,0.874,0.819,0.845
"And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.",我们发现， 事实上，提供的基金越多， 参购率就越低。,我们发现，提供的资金越多，参与率确实越低。,74.304,64.706,55.604,45.107,39.604,33.946,29.167,0.571,0.667,0.615,0.375,0.5,0.429,0.529,0.692,0.6,0.877,0.899,0.888
"So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be.",所以如果观察一下极端的情况的话， 会发现那些提供给客户两种基金的计划 的参购率在70左右， 仍然没有我们期待中的那么高。,因此，如果你看看极端情况，那些为你提供两种基金的计划，参与率大约在 70 年代中期 - 仍然没有我们希望的那么高。,64.105,49.439,37.872,31.002,29.017,21.763,50,0.581,0.643,0.61,0.265,0.29,0.277,0.543,0.594,0.567,0.819,0.831,0.825

"Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences.",由此看来， 即使是你真的选择参与一个计划， 当那么多计划摆在你面前时， 还是会造成负面的影响。,现在事实证明，即使你在有更多选择的情况下选择参与，即使如此，也会产生负面后果。,40.6,23.747,15.903,9.957,12.138,10.404,75,0.435,0.476,0.455,0.077,0.087,0.082,0.37,0.417,0.392,0.726,0.749,0.737
"So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.",所以对于那些选择参与计划的人来说， 选择越多， 他们越容易选择 完全避开股票或类似的基金。,因此，对于那些选择参与的人来说，选择越多，他们就越有可能完全避开股票或股票基金。,73.72,68.374,63.616,58.751,54.444,46.666,30.952,0.81,0.81,0.81,0.6,0.6,0.6,0.769,0.769,0.769,0.904,0.934,0.919

Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being.,现在，这两种极端选择 没有一种是当考虑到朋友未来的生活时， 我们会推荐给朋友的 好的选择。,现在，当您考虑人们未来的财务状况时，我们任何人都不会向您推荐这些极端的决定。,49.742,34.786,22.959,13.282,16.043,13.751,76.19,0.478,0.55,0.512,0.148,0.182,0.163,0.429,0.522,0.471,0.73,0.74,0.735

They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.,所造成的负面影响 他们越来越容易推迟选择的过程， 即使这样做会损害到自身的利益。,他们更有可能推迟选择——即使这违背了他们的最佳自身利益，他们也会拖延。,44.582,31.029,20.028,12.321,14.053,12.045,81.579,0.474,0.45,0.462,0.05,0.045,0.048,0.333,0.304,0.318,0.717,0.763,0.739

"The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display.",这是因为， 虽然我们很享受看一排一排 由美乃滋，黄芥末，醋和果酱建成的的高墙， 却不愿意亲自比较 然后在如此庞大的陈列中做出选择。,主要原因是，我们可能喜欢凝视那些巨大的蛋黄酱、芥末、醋、果酱墙，但我们实际上无法进行比较和对比的数学计算，也无法从令人惊叹的展示中实际挑选。,34.286,17.267,6.03,3.007,7.164,6.14,95.082,0.303,0.303,0.303,0,0,0,0.256,0.244,0.25,0.729,0.726,0.727
