"And the answer is, the ability to seek goals  will follow directly from this  in the following sense:  just like you would travel through a tunnel,  a bottleneck in your future path space,  in order to achieve many other  diverse objectives later on,  or just like you would invest  in a financial security,  reducing your short-term liquidity  in order to increase your wealth over the long term,  goal seeking emerges directly",答案是，寻找目标的能力 将直接遵循它， 道理是这样的： 就像你要穿过一条隧道， 你未来道路空间中的一个瓶颈， 为了在以后实现许多 其他的各种目标， 或者就像你会投资 于金融证券， 减少你的短期流动性 从而长远的增加你的财富， 目标的寻求直接涌现于,", , , ,   ⁇     ⁇     ⁇   , ,   ⁇   ,   ⁇   , ,   ⁇   ,   ⁇   , ,   ⁇   ,   ⁇   , ,   ⁇     ⁇   , ,   ⁇     ⁇     ⁇   ,   ⁇     ⁇   ,   ⁇     ⁇     ⁇   ,",7.883154953697652,0.745301365852356,0.7548466920852661,0.7359944581985474,91

"Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed  and you could pass only a single concept  on to our descendants  to help them rebuild civilization,  that concept should be  that all matter around us  is made out of tiny elements  that attract each other when they're far apart  but repel each other when they're close together.",最后，理查德 · 费曼， 这位著名的物理学家， 曾经写道， 如果人类文明被摧毁 并且你只能将一个概念 传承给我们的后代， 来帮助他们重建文明， 这个概念应该是 我们身边的一切物质 都是由微小的元素组成的， 它们之间距离远的时候 会相互吸引， 但在靠的很近时 它们会互相排斥。,", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,",22.6649812996976,0.796177327632904,0.8322844505310059,0.7630729079246521,77
