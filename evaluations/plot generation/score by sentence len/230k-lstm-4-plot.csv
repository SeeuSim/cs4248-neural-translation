"So by matching color, contrast and brightness  in the borders between the different images,  adding photographic defects  like depth of field,  desaturated colors and noise,  we erase the borders between the different images  and make it look like one single image,  despite the fact that one image  can contain hundreds of layers basically.",通过匹配不同照片边缘的 色彩，对比度以及亮度 再加入一下摄影瑕疵 比如视野的深度 去饱和的色彩和噪音 我们可以除去不同照片之间的边界 使其看起来就像是一张单一的照片 即使一张照片 可包含上百个图层,0.16241046162912467,0.4452355206012726,0.4289441704750061,0.46281325817108154,67
